# stock-analysis
###Module 2 - VBA with Excel Project
Refractering Code using TickerIndex
Sub AllStocksAnalysisRefract()
set tickerIndex = 0
Assign the row's ticker to ticker index to match the tickerIndex with other three variables.
If Cells(J, 1).Value = tickers(J) Then tickerIndex =J
Three output arrays - total volume, starting Price and EndingPrice -assigned with tickerIndex
Code is still receiving compiling error and needs debug.
Would you please help me with identifying my error?
Thanks
